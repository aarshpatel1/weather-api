# Weather API Website

This is a simple weather website that provides real-time weather information for any location using a weather API. It is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Current Weather Information**: Displays the current temperature, weather conditions, and location.
- **Search by City**: Allows users to search for weather information by entering a city name.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the website.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For fetching weather data from the API and updating the user interface.

## How It Works

1. The user enters the name of a city in the search bar.
2. The website sends a request to the weather API to fetch current weather information for that city.
3. The retrieved weather data is displayed on the website, including temperature, weather conditions, and the name of the location.
